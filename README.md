# Scripts
Working as a Sys admin, I've created a number of scripts.

Power off script:

Sdown command (script):

We couldn't get the powershell to run with group policy, so we adjusted our approach and created a simple command batch/cmd script that shuts down the computer giving the user a 10 minute warning. We then announced and put up signs that anyone can cancel this shutdown by typing 'shutdown /a' into the command prompt.
